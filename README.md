# SFpal
With SFpal, you can find your next community with ease. 

There are many factors to consider for an individual moving to a big city: rent price, commute time, safety, nightlife, restaurants, outdoor activities, noise, etc. Although you might be able to discover that information from a friend (or a friendâ€™s friend) we merge that data altogether onto one platform to make decisions easier for you. We leverage data to help you decide on an area to live in that caters most to your needs.
