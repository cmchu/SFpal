# SFpal
With SFpal, you can find your next community with ease. 

There are many factors to consider for an individual moving to a big city: rent price, commute time, safety, nightlife, restaurants, outdoor activities, noise, etc. Although you might be able to discover that information from a friend (or a friendâ€™s friend) we merge that data altogether onto one platform to make decisions easier for you. We leverage data to help you decide on an area to live in that caters most to your needs. 

## Community Definition
San Francisco can be divided into many different communities, based on demographics, physical boundaries, main streets, etc. The sizes of these communities can vary greatly. We desired community delineations that resulted in areas not too large (so that our app will actually have value to the user), but also areas not too small (so that the user will be able to find available housing). The two main community divisions we examined were zipcode and zoning district. We chose to use zipcode as the community definition because we felt that the zoning districts were too small and restrictive. However, we are open to changing this definition and have written the code to allow for this.

## Data Collection
One of the important aspects of this app is collecting accurate data on all different aspects of living. The following is a list of the types of data we collected and their source in no particular order:
